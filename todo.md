## RDF Issues

- Should we get rid of the `a rdf:Class` ? It seems pretty useless when there is a subclass... but it's needed when there is none so why not put it anyway?

## OWL? Issues

- Nothing says that ListOfMoves contains Moves

## General

- Add static github page
- Convert moves to moves on the board
- Connect to other team's ontology
